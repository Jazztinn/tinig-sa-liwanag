# scripted_native — Speaker 2 (Nimeesha De Guzman)

Second-speaker recording of the Script 3 elicitation set: 40 prompted
code-switch phrases across 8 domains (5 each), clap-separated, split with
`scripts/split_claps.py` detection. Kept **separate** from Speaker 1's
`data/audio/` (`hil_cs_001..040`) so the single-speaker headline benchmark is
unchanged; merge into the headline only after a multi-speaker decision.

- Speaker: Nimeesha De Guzman (`spk02`), native Hiligaynon, female.
- `subset: scripted_native`, `gold_status: native_gold`.
- Transcripts come from the script; per-word language tags were reviewed by the
  speaker (`lang_tags_status: reviewed`).
- Clip IDs `spk2_001..040` map 1:1 to Script 3 lines 1–40.
- This subset is not part of the headline benchmark yet because no bundled ASR
  predictions or benchmark report have been generated for the multi-speaker set.

## Cut quality

All **40** clips are `clip_quality: ok`.

Clap loudness was inconsistent in market/transport/culture, so amplitude
clap-splitting first merged lines and left junk tails. Those files were re-cut
with Whisper word-timestamp alignment to the known script lines, which recovered
clean boundaries for all but market lines 3–4 (Whisper mistranscribed line 4, so
its words bucketed into line 3). The speaker re-recorded lines 3 and 4 as
standalone clips, which replaced `spk2_003` / `spk2_004`.
