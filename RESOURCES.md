# External Resources

This project is translation-first for v1. Speech resources are still listed
because they matter for the future STT/TTS phase, but the immediate target is a
reviewed Hiligaynon text translation benchmark.

Check each resource's license before redistributing derived data.

## Translation and text resources

| Resource | Use | Link | Notes |
|----------|-----|------|-------|
| Kaufmann's Visayan-English Dictionary (KVED) | Hiligaynon lexicon and terminology checks | https://bohol.ph/kved.php | Use for manual lookup; do not bulk redistribute without checking terms. |
| Motus Hiligaynon Dictionary | Lexicon and usage checks | Internet Archive / UH ScholarSpace | Useful for reviewer reference. |
| pinoydictionary Hiligaynon | Queryable Hiligaynon dictionary | https://hiligaynon.pinoydictionary.com | Manual lookup only unless terms allow more. |
| kaikki.org Hiligaynon | Machine-readable Wiktionary-derived entries | https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Hiligaynon/ | Can seed `data/lexicon_hil_auto.tsv`; check CC BY-SA obligations. |
| kaikki.org Tagalog | Machine-readable Wiktionary-derived Tagalog entries | https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Tagalog/ | Can be bridged through English glosses to Hiligaynon entries. |
| Glosbe Tagalog-Hiligaynon | Direct online Tagalog-Hiligaynon dictionary and examples | https://glosbe.com/tl/hil | Use as reference/manual lookup; do not bulk scrape without checking terms. |
| ASJP Hiligaynon wordlist | Small machine-readable wordlist | https://asjp.clld.org | Useful for starter lexical coverage. |
| hilisenti-v1 | Hiligaynon text examples | https://huggingface.co/datasets/jjjardev/hilisenti-v1 | Check license before reuse. |

## Translation and language models

| Model | Use | Link |
|-------|-----|------|
| lfm25-sft-hiligaynon | Optional neural baseline for Hiligaynon text generation/translation | https://huggingface.co/welyjesch/lfm25-sft-hiligaynon |
| hiligaynon_llama_3.1 finetuned LoRA | Optional Hiligaynon text baseline | https://huggingface.co/PLTAT/hiligaynon_llama_3.1_finetuned_lora |
| hiligaynon_llama_3.1 tokenizer | Companion tokenizer | https://huggingface.co/PLTAT/hiligaynon_llama_3.1_finetuned_lora_tokenizer |
| hiligaynon_llama_3.1 FT 8B GGUF | Quantized local inference candidate | https://huggingface.co/PLTAT/hiligaynon_llama_3.1_FT_8B_GGUF |

Use these as baselines or fine-tuning starting points. Do not claim they are
accurate for Hiligaynon translation until they are evaluated on the benchmark
and reviewed by speakers.

## Building the dictionary baseline

The offline demo uses `data/lexicon_hil.tsv`, optionally merged with an
auto-built Wiktionary lexicon:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_dictionary.py
python3 scripts/translate_hil.py "Good morning, I went to the market yesterday"
```

The dictionary baseline is intentionally limited. It helps show why contextual
translation is needed.

For a noisy Tagalog -> Hiligaynon bridge lexicon from Kaikki/Wiktionary:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_tl_hil_lexicon.py
# writes data/lexicon_tl_hil_auto.tsv
```

This matches Tagalog and Hiligaynon words through shared English glosses. It is
useful for demo coverage, but it is not validated translation data.

## Benchmark sources to create yourselves

For the judged artifact, prioritize human-authored and human-reviewed examples:

- daily life instructions
- health and emergency messages
- classroom and education text
- public service announcements
- code-switched Filipino-English-Hiligaynon prompts
- ambiguous examples where context changes the correct translation

Avoid copying copyrighted paragraphs into the benchmark unless the license
explicitly allows redistribution.

## Future audio / speech data

These resources are deferred until after the text benchmark is credible.

## Licensing rule

The repo can release original benchmark rows under CC BY 4.0 only if the source
text and Hiligaynon reference are original or license-compatible. Keep
provenance notes for anything adapted from a third-party source.
